// Model a CrowdFunding platform, a project is defined by the GOAL, which is an amount of money they need to raise.
// The project has a description and also an end date, the project will have tiers that offer interesting rewards to
// funders, like the following
// Tier 1: 50€ - A T-shirt with my face in it
// Tier 2: 100€ - A T-shirt with my face in it and a set of stickers with my face
// Tier 3: 150€ - A T-shirt with my face in it, and a set of stickers with my face and a cup with my face
// There must be a way of keeping track of all the funders and their funding
// There must be a way of telling how much is left to get to the goal
// When a user provides funding they will receive the reward according to the tiers
